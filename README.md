# Sliding-Puzzle
Implements a sliding puzzles game solver, offering users the ability to find the shortest path from a designated start point 'S' to a target point 'F' within a given puzzle grid. The Main class serves as the program's entry point, presenting users with a menu to select from a range of preset puzzle configurations or opt for mass puzzles. Upon selection, the program initializes the PuzzleGame class with the chosen puzzle file and initiates the solving process. Within the PuzzleGame class, the solving algorithm employs a breadth-first search approach, exploring all possible paths from the start point to the target. Once the shortest path is found, it prints the sequence of movements required to traverse from 'S' to 'F', along with performance metrics indicating the time taken to solve the puzzle. This comprehensive solution demonstrates effective file input handling, pathfinding algorithms, and user interaction through a menu-driven interface, providing an engaging experience for solving sliding puzzles of varying complexities.
